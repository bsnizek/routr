##Welcome

Using this tool, we would like you to draw the route you would take by bicycle from __Trondheim Torv__
to your place of residence (see start point icon in the city centre). 
Remember that you do not need to be an active bicyclist to answer this question.
 
Please provide sufficient detail to show if you use the footpath or street.
 
To begin drawing a route, use single clicks on the map.
 
You can move the map using the arrow keys or by clicking and dragging, and you can zoom with the +/- buttons or 
scrollwheel.
 
You may move a point at any time and thereby adjust the route.
 
You can finish drawing by simply closing the tab/window.
 
We appreciate that you have taken the time to complete this survey. Have a lovely day!
 
<sub>Participants who have agreed to be contacted concerning follow-up surveys or survey results should 
expect to receive an email in the new year. The randomly selected winner of the gift card will be notified 
separately by email before Christmas.</sub>
