*(1) The search function doesn’t work very well. 
    It comes up with location not found for many of the important addresses where in this case the students live. 
    And in the cases where the location is found, it doesn’t actually zoom to this location when you hit ‘enter.’
    It may be easier just to have the start location near to the university and then students can find their own way around.

-(2) Click and drag of course works to navigate around the screen, but if you accidentally make a point, 
    it is again not possible to delete (as per my previous point). 
    Thus maybe a small hand icon for dragging around the screen could be useful?
 
* (3) Second thing is that when a location is found, 
    it doesn’t actually send the user to this location at a sufficient level of detail.
    
- (4) The routes that are saved in the http://trondheim.routr.dk/routes?user_id= 
    link change location depending on the scale of the map! 
    Not relative to each other but to the map at least.
    
* (5) The map is very grey and is quite tricky to find street names quickly. Are there different layer options with colours?
 
* (6) Can the line and point be slightly smaller or in some way more precise at low zoom levels? 
    If this is slightly bigger the more you zoom in, it gives the implication perhaps that more detail is desirable.
    
- (7) When editing the line, it then becomes not possible to add new points from the existing line. 
    Would it be best to have a pencil icon for route drawing which is automatically selected when you reach this page. 
    But can be reactivated again if some editing has occurred underway.

- (8) It is not possible to delete the last line (if it has been taken back to just 2 points).

- (9) Trying to make new points with a trackpad can be a bit troublesome. 
    If you have a finger on the trackpad it won’t register a new point if there is the slightest movement 
    (presumably the same for a mouse). Maybe no solution for this.
    
- (10)    Saving – double clicking usually is a zoom in function – maybe best not to make this a save option. 
        Since it also zooms in this window.
        
* (11)    UserID. If you delete or modify the userID, all of the previously drawn routes show up. 
        Is the intention of this such that I should only see the trips taken by one individual user?
        
* (12)    Can you explain what you mean by the QGIS saving method. 
        I do not know that I will necessarily be using QGIS, it may be ArcMap. 
        How would I do this if the file has no data in it?
